## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript (for rating logic)




### What I learned
I practiced structuring a component using BEM naming and fluid, accessible CSS with `clamp()`.  
I also learned how to manage interactive states using `aria-pressed` and how to swap between views dynamically.





### Continued development

I plan to improve accessibility features (keyboard navigation, focus rings)  
and experiment with transitions between the rating and thank-you states.
